ERROR:
ERROR 1248 (42000) at line 12: Every derived table must have its own alias

ANSWER BY CHATGPT:
pertains to the requirement in MySQL that any subquery used as a derived table in the FROM clause must have an alias assigned to it. This alias allows you to refer to the derived table within the outer query, enabling MySQL to understand the structure of the derived table.

-- Set two variables, one for the row count and one to act as the row_id
SET @ct := (SELECT COUNT(1) FROM STATION);
SET @row_id := 0;

-- Calculate the median latitude
SELECT ROUND(AVG(LAT_N),4) AS median
FROM (
    SELECT *, (@row_id := @row_id + 1) AS rn
    FROM STATION
    ORDER BY LAT_N
) AS station_with_row_number
WHERE rn BETWEEN @ct/2.0 AND @ct/2.0 + 1;
