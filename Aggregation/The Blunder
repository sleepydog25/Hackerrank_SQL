The Blunder

Samantha was tasked with calculating the average monthly salaries for all employees in the EMPLOYEES table, but did not realize her keyboard's 0 key was broken until after completing the calculation. She wants your help finding the difference between her miscalculation (using salaries with any zeros removed), and the actual average salary.

Write a query calculating the amount of error (i.e.: ACTUAL-MISCALCULATED average monthly salaries), and round it up to the next integer.

SELECT CEIL((AVG(SALARY))-(AVG(REPLACE(SALARY,"0",''))))
FROM EMPLOYEES;
